### Purpose
My Bible is designed to make it easy for you to have the Bible in your vault. Whether you're new to Obsidian or an experienced user, My Bible can help you quickly set up a Bible that you can use for study and reference.

### Who is it for?
My Bible is designed for any and all Christians who want to study the bible, and reference it in their notes. I believe everyone should have access to good notes for their studies, so My Bible is made to be quick and easy to set up in, even if you are not tech-savvy or an Obsidian super-user.

### How it works
My Bible sets up a folder structure and populates it with one note per chapter. The chapters don't contain the text of the Bible; the text is inserted as you read it, allowing you to have any translation you want represented by the same file/chapter/note. Because of this, you don't even need to download the entire Bible (unless you want to.)

### Getting started
1. To start, download the plugin from the *Community Plugins* list in the Obsidian settings.
2. Then, head to the settings for *My Bible* and change them how you like (you can do this later if you like.)
3. Then, press `ctrl+p` then search for and select the command `Build My Bible`.
4. Start linking notes to your Bible!

### Troubleshooting

Enjoy My Bible! God bless!
